  - title: Research and Innovation Website
    description: I took a class that built off of the technical 
      writings I had done, and me and my team worked to build a 
      website based off of those writings. We designed a website
      that ran via ASP.NET and designed the webpages using
      Bootstrap and a few custom bits of CSS code when needed.

  - title: My Portfolio
    description: This is the website you're currently on! I created
      this portfolio using Jekyll, a static site designer that uses
      the liquid templating language. All templating and design was
      custom made. Bootstrap is used in the background for its grid
      system and cross-platform compatability.

  - title: C# GUI Programming
    description: I took entry and advanced level C# programming courses.
     We made several programs, some of which used the command line and 
     others that used a GUI. This program is one of the more advanced GUI 
     applications I built that has multiple windows and properties.
